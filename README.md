# Overview

In this forked repository, I will create an application that uses CRUD operations including 'Create', 'Read', 'Update' and 'Delete'.

The application will have three different pages:

The first page 'Transaction Records' displays all the recorded transactions and adds an entry to the page. The page will also have the option to create a new entry and the option to edit and delete pre-existing entries.

On the second page 'Add Transaction',  the user will have the option to add an entry on the previous page. The user can add the Date and Amount values for the new entry.

For the third page, 'Edit Transaction' is accessed by clicking  the 'Edit entry' icon on the second page.  On this page, you can edit the Date and Amount values in the entry.
